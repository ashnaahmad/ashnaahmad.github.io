      <description>Or, &amp;ldquo;How to Get Britain Moving Again.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Written for the TxP Progress Prize., an essay contest in partnership with Civic Future and New Statesman Spotlight. In the spirit of the competition, I&amp;rsquo;ve explored a solution to resource allocation which goes against my economic instincts, but which has at its core a capable state apparatus that harnesses and democratises cutting-edge technology. I agree entirely with TxP that the apparent depth and entrenchment of certain societal problems do not make a solution any less viable - as long as we fully exploit the possibilities afforded to us by science and technology, and don&amp;rsquo;t wallow in despair!</description>

      <title>On being a failed dropout founder</title>

      <description>The dropout founder, while representing just 4% of unicorn founders, occupies an outsize place in the popular imagination. Their appeal is not unlike that of an action hero: they have outrageous levels of conviction and self-belief, but also a youthful earnestness and an obsession with impact that means you can&amp;rsquo;t help but root for them. There is some sense that the mere act of straying so far from established paths, at the age where they arguably exert the strongest pull, merits recompense; that anyone with the strength of character to do this is bound to be successful eventually.</description>

      <title>Slavophilia and Socialist Realism</title>

      <description>Written in 2019, in my past life as an aspiring modern languages degree candidate.&#xA;While much of Europe spent the 19th century reshaping its systems of political and economic organisation, an intense intellectual debate in Russia was redefining the very nature of Russian-ness. The legacy of rulers like Peter I and Catherine I, who were responsible for modernising Russia’s courts, overhauling its army and dramatically increasing its foreign influence and artistic prowess, was deeply divisive.</description>

      <description>TLDR Hi! I’m Ashna, a 22 y/o VC dividing my time between Amsterdam, London and Paris. Before starting my venture capital career, I studied computational cognitive science, interned in B2B sales, software engineering and product management roles, and had a crack at building my own startup.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in science-backed ways to empower humans to make more creative, informed and impactful decisions. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to question assumptions about social organisation and build societies that enable us to lead fulfilling lives, despite - or perhaps because of - shifting material and technological grounds.</description>

title: Marxism - a Modern Utopia?
---
_Originally written for the H.G. Wells Society newsletter in 2016 (when I was 14 and did not know how to reference properly)_

1905 was an incredibly exciting time to be contemplating the future. The 19th century had been a century of immense change, and as it drew to a close, a number of emergent ideas about humanity had to be integrated into the “intellectual landscape” of the world. _A Modern Utopia_ was from the outset an attempt to conceptualise a utopia compatible with the post-Enlightenment, post-Industrial Revolution mode of thought: one compatible with the “modern dreamer” and the age after “Darwin quickened the thought of the world.[1](#fn:1)

Unsurprisingly, the developments of the 19th century also spawned innovations in strands of political philosophy which did not proclaim to be utopian, and indeed polemicised against utopianism. One of these, and a hugely influential one at that, was Marxism. Marxism was developed to be a “scientific socialism” in blunt opposition to the now almost extinct utopianism of Owen, Fourier and others, and its task “was no longer to manufacture a system of society as perfect as possible, but to examine the historico-economic succession of events.”[2](#fn:2) In other words, the modern, Marxist-influenced socialist currents are characterised by the very fact that they are not utopian. Yet even so, socialists are routinely accused of “utopianism.” To an extent, everyone with a desire to improve society has the same end goal as utopians: “the essay into a better future.”[3](#fn:3) But although where to draw the line between being radical and being utopian is still a point of contention, this essay shall attempt to compare the society envisaged in _A Modern Utopia_ with the communist vision and use the standards Wells set to establish the extent of the latter’s utopianism.

As would be expected given the similar goals of all visionaries, there are several similarities between the two societies. Most of these similarities, however, stem not from a shared utopianism, but from a shared progressivism; that is, the fact that both communism and Wells’ utopian vision involve taking some aspects of modern society and extending them further as opposed to erasing them and replacing them with older, “correct” methods of social organisation (as reactionaries advocate). This progressivism appears to exist for both Marx and Wells on a theoretical level. Heraclitus, whose ideas on dialectics were resurrected by Hegel and Marx , is quoted as saying that “everything flows and nothing abides”[4](#fn:4), a sentiment echoed by Wells, who writes “There is no abiding thing in what we know.”[5](#fn:5) If everything inherently changes and progresses, society must change accordingly, and therefore a desirable or utopian vision of a society must be neither regressive nor static, “but kinetic.”[6](#fn:6) This theoretical commonality gives rise to practical commonalities.

The most obvious “progressive” feature held in common by the two societies on a practical level is the transformation of social relations and liberation of humanity by technological advancement. This is fundamental to Marxism. Historical materialism is in essence the notion that a continuous process of development of productive forces causes different systems of economic organisation (and corresponding political systems) to emerge and die out at each stage of development: the notion that “the hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist.”[7](#fn:7) It is never explicitly said that technological development itself would solve the contradictions in capitalism, but the socialist/communist society does “presuppose a level of development of the productive forces of society”, as well as of “the productivity of social labour”, which will provide overabundance of goods.[8](#fn:8)

Similarly, in _A Modern Utopia_, the idea of using technology as an emancipatory force, since “the social fabric rests no longer upon human labour”[9](#fn:9), is thoroughly embraced. An even clearer parallel with Marxism is the connection which Wells immediately makes between technological advancement and “abolishing the last base reason for anyone’s servitude or inferiority”[10](#fn:10), stating that due to “the new conditions physical science is bringing about…a labouring class… will become unnecessary to the world of men.”[11](#fn:11) This “class of workers without personal initiative”[12](#fn:12) is none other than the proletariat, the very class upon whose abolition of “itself as proletariat”[13](#fn:13) communism is predicated.

There are also some similarities between the societies in the social sphere, but as with the economic similarities, many of these can be are reducible to the essential progressivism which these two societies share.

The 19th century was the one during which globalisation really took off; and when _A Modern Utopia_ was written, this showed no signs of ending. It was probably around this time that progressivism became so closely linked to internationalism. The final line of _The Communist Manifesto_, “Workers of the world, unite!” epitomises the Marxist belief that no less than a planet would serve the purpose of communism, just as “no less than a planet would serve the purpose of a modern utopia.”[14](#fn:14) Wells notes that “the whole trend of modern thought is against the permanence of such enclosures \[as nation-states\]”[15](#fn:15) – and therefore towards the inverse: something similar to the “global republic of labour” of socialist theory. In a modern utopia, much as in a borderless communism, “the whole world will be open and accessible and…habituated to the coming and going of strangers.”[16](#fn:16)

Elsewhere in the social realm, we find some statements on the matters of child-rearing, sex/gender and race which would not have looked out of place in First International documents. In the Modern Utopia, “for all purposes of the individual, women are to be as free as men. This will certainly be realised in the Modern Utopia if it can be realised at all – not only for women’s sake but for man’s”[17](#fn:17) and different races will “intermingle pretty freely.”[18](#fn:18) In the same vein, the French Workers’ Party wrote in 1880 that “the emancipation of the productive class is that of all human beings without distinction of sex or race.”[19](#fn:19) Utopia will even have “increasing control of a child’s welfare and upbringing by the community”[20](#fn:20) which is reminiscent of the famous communist notion of the sublation of the family and “\[replacement of\] home education by social”[21](#fn:21)

That seems to be where the similarities end. As you may have noticed, these similarities all apply to the outlines of communist and Utopian society, and not to the actual methods of socioeconomic organisation – which are nothing alike. Despite ostensibly being based on “the hypothesis of the complete emancipation of a community of men from tradition”[22](#fn:22), the modern Utopia is a slightly tweaked but still probably feasible version of capitalism, ensconced in traditional beliefs about humanity. The clearest example of this is the postulation that since “money is…a necessary thing in civilised human life”[23](#fn:23) there will be no “free demand of commodities from a central store” due to the “inherent moral dross in man.”[24](#fn:24) This is a variant of the human nature argument, an argument often accompanied by accusations of utopianism. Surely, someone trying to create a utopia, a “most distinctly impracticable” world[25](#fn:25) which is free of traditional thinking and organisation would not refer to such a bastion of philosophical orthodoxy? And surely, if this utopian society takes human nature and thereby practicability into account, it is not so utopian.

This is not the only example of practicability which we see in the modern utopia. The _samurai,_ the voluntary elite of Utopian society, are said to carry out “the whole of the responsible rule of the world”[26](#fn:26) , to be responsible for such tasks as “legislation\* and employment\* of\* labour”_,_ and it is argued that this legislation is needed because “we should certainly not be free to kill, assault or threaten anyone we met”[27](#fn:27), showing that there is of course a state in this utopia and implying that people kill, assault and threaten others out of some kind of abstract desire which cannot even be changed in a utopia. And although “there is no private fortune in the whole world that is more than a little thing beside the wealth of the State”[28](#fn:28), “besides…shares in business adventures, Utopia will no doubt permit associations of its citizens to have a property in various sorts of contracts and concessions.”[29](#fn:29) So Utopia has private ownership of some means of production, a state and a market system with money and commodity circulation. The communist society, in which “the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and the direction of the processes of production…the state is not “abolished”, it withers away”[30](#fn:30), market exchange is replaced by economic planning and “human nature” is not taken into account, is thus _further away_ from capitalist society and from what is considered practicable than a deliberate exercise in utopianism!

This seems to indicate that communism is but another modern utopia. However, it is important to note that this comparison has measured “practicability” exclusively in terms of “similarity to current society.” Although there is no other way to measure practicability without resorting to speculation, this does mean that writing off communism completely would not be justified at this point in time, since by this logic, absolutely any revolutionary idea in history could have been called utopian before being put into practice. Communism, given favourable material conditions, could still potentially prove itself. The impossibility of objectively measuring its utopianism just shows that the term “utopianism” is, and always will be, subject to ideological manipulation.

title: Slavophilia and Socialist Realism
---

_Written in 2019._

While much of Europe spent the 19th century reshaping its systems of political and economic organisation, an intense intellectual debate in Russia was redefining the very nature of Russian-ness. The legacy of rulers like Peter I and Catherine I, who were responsible for modernising Russia’s courts, overhauling its army and dramatically increasing its foreign influence and artistic prowess, was deeply divisive. Although both of these rulers presided over usually popular developments – most notably military victory during the Great Northern War and Russo-Turkish wars – some of the most striking examples of their repressive leadership were their responses to those who challenged their progressive agenda, including the suppression of the Streltsy Rebellion[1](#fn:1) and of around 160 popular uprisings between 1762 and 1772.[2](#fn:2) In Russia, modernity did not always seem to have positive connotations.

This battle between decidedly forward-thinking rulers and a vocal chunk of the population who opposed them formed the backdrop against which the Slavophile tradition was born. In contrast to the group of intellectuals known as Westernisers, who, in Riasanovsky’s words, embraced Peter I as “the victorious creator of the Russian empire and its might, the sage organizer of the state, the lawgiver of modern Russia"[3](#fn:3), the group who identified themselves as Slavophiles believed that his reforms were at odds with Russia’s fundamental character. They were prompted to become more vocal in civil discourse by Peter Chaadaev’s controversial _Philosophical Letters,_ published in 1829,\* in which he wrote (of Russia):

Isolated in the world, we have given nothing to the world, we have taught nothing to the world; we have not added a single idea to the mass of human ideas; we have contributed nothing to the progress of the human spirit.[4](#fn:4)

For Chaadaev, Russia’s isolation from the West was to blame for its lack of meaningful progress; “\[Russians\] have never moved in concert with other peoples” and so “the universal education of mankind has not touched us.”[5](#fn:5) The Slavophiles’ response was that realising this separation from Western Europe by establishing a form of social organisation based on their own traditions was exactly what would improve Russia, rather than seeking to imitate a foreign model.[6](#fn:6) They regarded the West as decadent and morally inferior; to them, Western people “were guilty of a multitude of sins. Egoism, communism, rationalism, sensuality, pride, affectation, superficiality, cruelty, bellicosity, exploitation, luxury, deceptiveness, rapacity, treachery, lechery, corruption, and decay were among

“Their” attributes.”[7](#fn:7) Given that communism was included in this list of sins, it might seem obvious that socialist realism cannot be considered part of the Slavophile tradition. To Slavophiles, socialist realism would have been viewed as a product of Western thought due to its aim of promoting communist ideology – indeed, Solzhenitsyn did criticise communism as the imposition of an alien, Western system on Russia.[8](#fn:8) Meanwhile, socialist realists thought of their work as a new stage in artistic evolution – just as communism was a new stage in societal evolution – as opposed to the return to traditional ways championed by Slavophiles.[9](#fn:9)

On the other hand, we have already seen one similarity between the two schools of thought: the socialist government, and therefore the artwork it sanctioned, shared the Slavophiles’ disdain for Western societies (in this case, because they were bastions of bourgeois capitalism). Moreover, according to Dobrenko, this disdain was part of a conservative, even nationalist desire to create a “properly Russian, egalitarian, pseudo- collectivist, anti-market, anti-bourgeois, anti-Western \[…\] socialist utopia”[10](#fn:10) which existed alongside support for rapid industrialisation and the notion of proletarian internationalism. Thus, even though socialist realism was supposedly an entirely new, revolutionary style of art distinct from previous ‘bourgeois’ art, running through its Russian incarnation were echoes of a century-old duality: the coexistence of a muted admiration of Western liberal technocracy and an instinctive repulsion by it. To examine this further, this essay will compare the key values and the portrayal of Russia and Russians which can be seen in the ideas of Slavophiles and socialist realists, in order to determine to what extent socialist realism was simply a red-tinted continuation of Slavophilia.

According to Slavophiles, the moral decay of Western Europe was rooted in its adoption of inferior forms of Christianity. Their opposition to Westernisation could in part be reduced to a belief that the Russian Orthodox Church had a special place in Russian history, and that emulating Western mores which were informed by Catholicism would corrupt the uniquely Orthodox character of Russia.[11](#fn:11) In fact, any authority which attempted to place itself above the Church in the hierarchy of Russian society was automatically opposed by Slavophiles, including the government of Nicholas I – which, despite its official mantra of ’Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality’, prioritised autocracy over orthodoxy and aimed to render the Church subordinate to the state.[12](#fn:12) Immediately, the central position of religion in Slavophile ideas appears to set it apart from socialist realism; a movement with the goal of developing a secular, proletarian culture surely could not be part of a tradition with the goal of restoring the hegemony of religious authority. As well as this obvious difference in values, the reasoning behind Slavophiles’ opposition to Western styles of governance reveals another difference between them and socialist realists. The concept of moral decay is at odds with ’scientific socialism.’ Engels wrote in _Anti-Dühring_ that:

We therefore reject every attempt to impose on us any moral dogma whatsoever as an eternal, ultimate and forever immutable ethical law on the pretext that the moral world, too, has its permanent principles which stand above history and the differences between nations. We maintain on the contrary that all moral theories have been hitherto the product, in the last analysis, of the economic conditions of society obtaining at the time. And as society has hitherto moved in class antagonisms, morality has always been class morality; it has either justified the domination and the interests of the ruling class, or ever since the oppressed class became powerful enough, it has represented its indignation against this domination and the future interests of the oppressed.[13](#fn:13)

Socialists therefore support the furthest thing possible from a permanent religious authority whose close relationship to Russian identity gives it an unquestionable right to the highest power in Russia. They reject any idea of morality on the grounds that it necessarily reflects ruling class ideology, and so for them, the defects of Western systems of government do not lie in an inherent moral corruption but in the specific class antagonisms within those systems at a certain point in time.

While not based on ethical propositions, however, socialist criticisms had another objective basis: the historical materialist theory of social history. Dialectical and historical materialism are characterised by their rather bold claim to have formulated a set of laws by which societal development invariably unfolds. Tellingly, in his 1938 publication _Dialectical and Historical Materialism_, Stalin (socialist realism’s biggest sponsor) stresses the ostensibly objective and scientific nature of the theory, referring multiple times to the ‘laws’ of social history and the idea that “the _science_ of the history of society can become _as precise a science_ as, let us say, biology”[14](#fn:14) (italics added). That Russian socialists were so quick to embrace the purported objectivity of Marxist analysis suggests that they had an appetite for such objectivity, and sought scientific justification for it in the absence of religion. Slavophiles’ advocacy of the supremacy of religious authority based on unchanging cultural and ethical values represented a deep-seated conservative morality; socialist realists, although they replaced this authority and these values with ’progressive’ ones, retained their veneration of the immutable.

The subject of authority is another area with more commonalities than there initially seem to be. Both Slavophiles and socialists are associated with authoritarianism, but their attitudes towards authority are more nuanced and contingent than blindly reverential. In Slavophile thought, an ideal Russian state would use autocratic methods to enforce traditional values. However, any state which did not uphold truly Russian principles would be viewed with suspicion by Slavophiles, who believed that authoritarianism was often connected to the imposition of alien values on the Russian people.[15](#fn:15) This was the kernel of their aforementioned dispute with Nicholas I, a ruler who superficially shared many of their values. Socialist ideology likewise does not contain the slightest hint of unconditional respect for authority. On the contrary, it encourages insurrection against oppressive bourgeois governments, of the sort that Stalin’s government funded (most significantly through their backing of the PSUC during the Spanish Civil War) and ultimately supports a society in which the state has ’withered away.’ Both Lenin and Stalin made it very clear that although the end goal was a stateless society, a strong proletarian state would be desirable. As Lenin wrote (and Stalin quoted):

The dictatorship of the proletariat is the rule—unrestricted by law and based on force—of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, a rule enjoying the sympathy and support of the labouring and exploited masses.[16](#fn:16)

In addition, “the dictatorship of the proletariat does not differ fundamentally from the dictatorship of any other class.”[17](#fn:17) Therefore, just as the bourgeoisie or nobility coercively suppressed other classes under capitalism and feudalism, the proletariat would do the same and be justified in doing so. Slavophilic conditional authoritarianism shows why this view of authority might have been easy to digest in Russia; Russians were used to the basic notion that autocracy was not inherently preferable, but the right kind of autocratic government was worth respecting.

Socialist realist art put this take on authority into practice during Stalin’s premiership. A lesser-known conflict between Slavophiles and Westernisers during the 19th century

concerns how to bridge the divide between elite and mass culture: Westernisers maintained that the intellectual level of the masses needed to be raised to that of the intelligentsia, whereas Slavophiles favoured simplifying literature to ‘bring it to the people.’[18](#fn:18) The intention of socialist realists was not to bridge this divide, but to transcend it.[19](#fn:19) This implies a different sort of discontinuity between Slavophilic and socialist realist ideas: as socialists might have argued, the reason behind the reproduction of certain Slavophile ideas in socialist realism could be the sublation of pre-socialist debates entailed by the proletarian revolution, which would mean that socialist realism is part of a new tradition with a few lingering vestiges of the culture which preceded it. However, socialist realists employed a particular top-down style of stimulating mass cultural engagement which had more than a little in common with the Slavophilic populist-authoritarian hybrid.

The first similarity between the two relates to the regulation of artistic expression in the Soviet Union under Stalin. The picture we often have in the West of the arts in the Soviet Union is one of tightly-controlled, Marxist conformism, where every brushstroke and every comma must sing a song of eternal proletarian glory. Of course, there was censorship and a certain degree of _partiinost’_ to which the cultural intelligentsia had to conform, but since artists were not required to be party members, the orthodoxies of pre- Soviet art and literature were allowed to filter through into socialist consciousness just as socialist values filtered into the work of the former ‘bourgeois’ intelligentsia. Rather than being dominated by Marxism, creative output under Stalin was dominated by an overarching conservatism, which gave artists immense impetus to conform not only to the orthodoxy of socialist realism but also to imitate the artists of the past who were afforded the greatest respect: Pushkin in poetry, Stanislavsky in theatre, the Itinerants (19th century Russian realists) in painting.[20](#fn:20) Thus, although one of the stated objectives of socialist realism was to create a new art style which was accessible and relevant to workers,[21](#fn:21) they did so by appealing to traditional Russian artistic convention and strongly promoting conformity to it. The restrictive environment which came to exist as a result bore little resemblance to the revolutionary futurism which flourished immediately after the 1917 revolutions, and seems more like the return to tradition welcomed by Slavophiles.

The second similarity lies in the innate authoritarianism of the art style itself. As Stalin consolidated his grip on power, the fourth tenet of socialist realism agreed on at the Congress of 1934 – portraying the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its mission in a positive light[22](#fn:22) - increasingly developed into the near-deification of Stalin as a person. A famous example is _Under the Banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin_, created by Gustav Klutsis in 1935 using photomontage:

![](/images/Aspose.Words.20ec32c2-ceab-4bce-80a4-c55275f39206.001.png)

This poster contains many of the defining features of socialist realist art. The background is an unmistakeably industrial setting divided into four sections, of which the first three show struggle and revolution, while the fourth shows a crowd of beaming workers, appearing to be marching forward. Photomontage has been used to superimpose the heads of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin onto the scene, on a red banner, as if they were watching over the victorious workers below them. The symbolism of the chimneys and the crowd are obvious: the poster is heralding the victory of the industrial proletariat and emphasising the collective nature of class struggle and progress towards communism.

This is not an image of perfect equality, though. The depiction of the four Marxist leaders is typical of the artistic methods used to foster Stalin’s personality cult: their positioning above the crowd and at the centre of the image gives the impression that they are to be respected, and out of the four, Stalin stands out for being the only forward-facing head. The other three leaders are looking in his direction, as if looking towards the communist future he represents, and directly beneath his gaze is a large group of workers unified by their smiling faces and their implied forward motion. This poster is not about the proletariat as a whole, or the revolution as a whole, or the goal of a free and equal society; it is about the line of great communist leaders whose climax was Stalin, and how Stalin continued and deepened the legacy of his predecessors by ensuring the happiness of the masses pictured below him. In other words, this poster is a paean to authority. Ironically, socialist realists’ efforts to create a proletarian culture involved more conservatism and more leader-worship than ever, bringing to mind the peculiarly authoritarian brand of populism so beloved of Slavophiles.

The final aspect of this comparison between Slavophiles and socialist realists is the ends of each movement: the kind of society, and indeed the kind of individual, which Slavophiles and socialist realists strove to form and regarded as the pinnacle of human capability. Even in this area, there appear to be some glaring similarities between the ideologies. As ever, the ideal society envisaged by Slavophiles displays a characteristic ambiguity concerning the question of the state. The original Russian method of sociopolitical organisation, free from any Western influences, was said to have been a harmonious, co-operative and peaceful peasant commune (_mir_ or _obshchina_), in which there existed no coercion and “a natural and moral fraternity \[among Russians\].”[23](#fn:23) A lack of coercion, of course, implies the lack of a state apparatus. This anarchistic concept of a network of stateless, freely- associated communes defined by their Russian quality is not dissimilar to the communist vision. Marx and Engels describe the formation of a society without political power in _The Communist Manifesto_:\*

When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. \[…\] In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.[24](#fn:24)

It is important to note that this society without class distinctions was theoretically the aesthetic ideal of socialist realism, given that one purpose of socialist realism was to provide a positive, hopeful depiction of the direction of social progress.[25](#fn:25) Even the nationalism of the Slavophiles’ outlook, which prized communal organisation by virtue of its Russian-ness, could be seen to some extent in socialist realist doctrine. Art was required to be “national in form, Socialist in content”, particularly after World War 2, when patriotic allegiance to the Soviet Union was combined with allegiance to the communist mission in order to win over citizens of the new Eastern Bloc.[26](#fn:26)

The motive of winning people over provided much of the impetus behind the cultural recycling responsible for socialist realism’s conservative undertones. Cultural recycling is the process of imbuing familiar symbols with new meanings, to communicate a new idea using symbols which already have positive associations. Often, socialism was the new idea, while Orthodox icons were the familiar symbols. Dmitry Moor’s _Christmas_ (1921) is an example:

![](/images/Aspose.Words.20ec32c2-ceab-4bce-80a4-c55275f39206.002.jpeg)

Moor was firmly on the realist side of the realism vs. abstraction debate of the early 1920s, and as well as exemplifying early realism, this poster clearly uses traditional Russian symbolism. Transfiguration, in Russian Orthodoxy, involves a halo or rays of light shining down on a person or object to bestow divine sanction upon them, and is evoked by the depiction of light rays shining down on the field. As transfiguration represents divinely-sanctioned legitimacy and the sun represents salvation through Christ, the red star placed (tellingly) over the sun and the rays it emits represent salvation through revolution and the blessing given to workers to carry out their ‘holy’ mission. Due to cultural recycling, many quintessentially Russian motifs were incorporated into socialist realism, giving it – in a sense – the Russian-ness to which Slavophiles aspired. Though such similarities exist, for the most part, the idealised society of socialist realist art was not a descendant of the Russian peasant commune. Socialist realism gives an impression of rigidity, of having one constant party line which must always be followed, and this makes it easy to forget that this art movement is laden with contradictions - as the ideas of its originators frequently were. Though the Communist Party did promote ‘Russification’ in the 1930s, seeking to unite the disparate nationalities within Soviet borders under a common, _Soviet_ identity and language as war approached, it was always careful to distance ‘Soviet patriotism’ from the bourgeois Russian nationalism it roundly condemned. Russians were not praised for their innate spiritual purity, but for having led the international proletariat by carrying out the first revolution.[27](#fn:27) The hope was that the rest of the global proletariat would join the Russians to form an international communist society, and when this happened, Russia would not be superior in any way. Unlike Slavophilic patriotism, this patriotism was transient, with the pursuit of international ends in mind.

Moreover, far from creating backward yet wholly Russian peasant communes, Soviet leaders desperately wanted to bring their country in line with the industrialisation levels of Western Europe. The ideal Soviet citizen was not a peasant, but an industrial proletarian, working hard to make his country more modern and productive.[28](#fn:28) Socialist realism reflects this appetite for modernisation using romanticised industrial settings. The poster below (left), _Help Build the Gigantic Factories_ (Mirzoyan and Ivanov, 1929), advertises the first Five Year Plan and the heavy industrialisation it called for by portraying industry as beautiful and its construction as a glorious, collaborative effort. Industrial imagery was even used on fabric prints such as Golubev’s _Red Spinner_ (right), designed in 1930.

![](/images/Aspose.Words.20ec32c2-ceab-4bce-80a4-c55275f39206.003.png)![](/images/Aspose.Words.20ec32c2-ceab-4bce-80a4-c55275f39206.004.jpeg)

The depiction of industry and technology as not only necessary but _beautiful_ shows how central it was to the socialist realist worldview. This contrasts sharply with Slavophiles’ idealisation of peasant-based societies. Although they opportunistically employed Russian and Orthodox imagery, the society socialist realists strove to create was technologically-advanced, modern and highly efficient, sharing more similarities with the European societies loathed by Slavophiles than with any peasant commune.

It is undeniable that, for all its modernising rhetoric, an idealistic, nationalistic conservatism comparable to Slavophile nostalgia was present in socialist realist thought. However, the opportunistic way in which this conservatism was used to entice formerly religious and patriotic workers, rather than out of any true fidelity to Orthodoxy, advocacy for peasant causes or belief in the inherent supremacy of Russian-ness, indicates that Slavophiles were never truly their ideological progenitor. The relevance of this essay does not come from unearthing a hidden fraternity between two ostensibly opposed schools of thought, but from noting that quasi- Slavophilic ideas have had a unique allure to Russians for centuries. In the 21st century, as an oddly familiar brand of insular traditionalism is used to drum up Russian support for interventionism abroad and autocracy at home, understanding these ideas is the key to understanding Russia itself.

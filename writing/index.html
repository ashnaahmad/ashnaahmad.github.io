                                    <p><em>Or, &ldquo;How to Get Britain Moving Again.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Written for the <a href="https://txp.fyi/progress-prize">TxP Progress Prize.</a>, an essay contest in partnership with Civic Future and New Statesman Spotlight. In the spirit of the competition, I&rsquo;ve explored a solution to resource allocation which goes against my economic instincts, but which has at its core a capable state apparatus that harnesses and democratises cutting-edge technology. I agree entirely with TxP that the apparent depth and entrenchment of certain societal problems do not make a solution any less viable - as long as we fully exploit the possibilities afforded to us by science and technology, and don&rsquo;t wallow in despair!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The sky is blue, the youngest generation is lazy, and Britain has a productivity problem. In the years since the financial crisis, we’ve had a steady stream of policy efforts motivated by this problem. These ranged from anaemic (Rishi Sunak’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4a82f546-1031-4448-9db2-4d339c32d8c1">half-hearted levelling-up strategy</a>) to disastrous (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/30/liz-truss-uk-economic-crisis">did someone say rotting lettuce?</a>). Yet productivity has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2a0dbab1-f6a5-4432-8984-4112638dfdf0">grown by just 1.7% during this period</a>. This has cost the average British worker £10,700 per year in lost earnings and left us lagging conspicuously behind the US, Germany and France.</p>
<p>This is not for a lack of think pieces. There is <a href="https://fullfact.org/economy/very-old-problem-productivity-britain/">cross-party consensus</a> that low productivity is a problem. The <em>Financial Times</em> seems to run monthly stories on the issue. The Resolution Foundation and the LSE ran an inquiry and recently published the resulting economic strategy recommendations, including policy suggestions to fix education decline, the skills gap, lacklustre business investment, and gaping regional inequalities.</p>
<p>Though few would dispute this grim consensus on the productivity problem, I can’t help feeling that the widespread dissatisfaction amongst the British public comes from a more fundamental place. Eight out of ten Britons <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/eight-ten-britons-are-dissatisfied-how-government-running-country">are dissatisfied with the way the government is running the country</a>; the same proportion think <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/05/britons-personally-optimistic-nationally-pessimistic-research-finds">“the world out there” will stay the same or get worse.</a> Anxiety about the future and <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/ipsos-trust-in-professions-veracity-index-2023">historic levels of distrust</a> are hanging in the air.</p>
<p>And no wonder. Over the last 10 years, child poverty rates in Britain have increased <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/report-card-18-child-poverty-amidst-wealth">more than in any other OECD country</a>. 4.7 million tonnes of (still edible) food were <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/resources/report/food-surplus-and-waste-uk-key-facts-updated-november-2023">wasted</a> in 2022, yet 9 million households experience moderate or severe <a href="https://foodfoundation.org.uk/initiatives/food-insecurity-tracking#tabs/Round-13">food insecurity</a>: a shocking increase of 10% in 2 years. This points to a deeper problem with the way resources are distributed.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe the problem is too fundamental for policy tweaks to make much of a difference. For instance, some argue that the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6ada0002-9a57-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d">prevalence of low-skilled workers</a> in the UK has stalled wage and productivity growth, and propose education policies aimed at tackling this so-called skills gap. But how can we improve educational outcomes if as many as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/21/children-have-bowed-legs-hunger-worse-than-ever-says-norwich-school">7% of pupils are malnourished</a>?</p>
<p>To restart growth in wages and productivity, we should start by rethinking resource allocation. This is where Chilean telexes come in. In 1970, Salvador Allende’s democratic socialist government began an ill-fated attempt at computational economic planning. They used a type of Bayesian forecasting to make predictions based on production data and give the government “a bird’s-eye view of the economy.” “Interventors would use the telex machines at their enterprises to send production data to the telex machine located at the National Computer Corporation,” explains Eden Medina in *Cybernetic Revolutionaries. “*The computer ran statistical software programs that compared the new data with those collected previously. If the program encountered a variation, it would send the data over the telex network to the State Development Corporation (CORFO) and the interventors affected. As a result, CORFO would communicate with the interventors in order to help resolve the problem.”</p>
<p>Medina notes that their approach was surprisingly successful despite technical bottlenecks. During the sweeping 1972 strikes led by the opposition, “the government kept food supplies between 50 and 70 percent of the normal supply. It also maintained 90 percent of normal fuel distribution levels with only 65 percent of the tanker trucks in operation.” Later that year, a military coup brought down Allende’s government. Over the next two decades, the Cold War would draw to a close, and large-scale economic planning - no matter how digitised - would never reach the Western intellectual mainstream.</p>
<p>Even now, economic planning evokes <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/page/hayek-the-use-of-knowledge-in-society">Hayekian takes</a> at best and memories of the Holodomor at worst. The Soviet command economy model has been objectively and completely invalidated by the humanitarian catastrophe it created. But planning does not have to mean centralisation. Remarkably, Allende and Hayek were in agreement that, in Hayek’s words, “the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes […] the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances.” Allende’s chief technologist, Anthony Stafford Beer, <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Fanfare-for-Effective-Freedom-:-Cybernetic-Praxis-Beer/73834bd4299ad9578e5da64018f3508b9dbc1089">intended the computational planning system to maximise devolution</a> and ensure that networks of workers spread across the country could collaborate on economic planning.</p>
<p>Advances in machine learning provide a strong technical case for revisiting decentralised economic planning. Deep learning algorithms are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10844-021-00666-5#Sec7">especially strong at constraint satisfaction problems</a>, of which resource allocation problems are a subset. The private sector has already noticed. Traditional grocery stores have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/12/the-grocery-industrys-shopping-list-inventory-management-frictionless-checkout-computer-vision/">pouring money</a> into inventory management software, which uses state-of-the-art machine learning to predict demand, reduce waste, and track and streamline supply chains. At its core, the computational process is suspiciously similar to the tracking and forecasting of socialist Chile.</p>
<p>Ocado became the UK’s biggest tech company precisely by applying machine learning to resource allocation in the grocery industry. The Ocado Smart Platform uses customer demand forecasting to determine how much to order from suppliers. This planning approach has led to some seriously impressive reduction in food waste: Ocado <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/media/press-releases/ocado-reveals-near-zero-food-waste-levels">wastes just 1 in 6000 produce items</a>, a fraction of other major grocery retailers.</p>
<p>But the UK’s 9 million households in food insecurity are <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/supermarkets/article/supermarket-price-comparison-aPpYp9j1MFin">probably not buying their groceries from Ocado</a>. This is where the government should step in. The simplest way to start would be government incentives to make it easier (and more appealing) for retailers to adopt inventory management software. For most grocery retailers, the technical barrier to entry is still too high - and for retailers that do have some type of inventory management software, it may not be explicitly aimed at sustainability or equitable resource distribution. A combined food waste/digital transformation fund could lower these barriers to entry, financially incentivise companies to cut food waste, and encourage digital management of partnerships with food banks and community organisations to ensure surplus food is properly redistributed.</p>
<p>A more ambitious idea could be for the government to take a more proactive role in gathering the data needed for economic planning and making it accessible. This could mean that redistribution of surplus food to vulnerable populations becomes a joint effort by the government and the private sector, which should make it less scrappy and more consistent. It could also bring together data from various companies’ sources to create a repository for wider demand.</p>
<p>In short, the goal of government involvement would be to harmonise standards for data-driven inventory management and food waste reduction across the grocery industry. Of course, there are still many questions about how exactly to implement this, how to avoid reducing competition, and how to improve the government’s own data management capabilities before it can effectively assist the private sector. But ultimately, we have the technology to dramatically reduce both hunger and food waste in the UK. What we need to do now is democratise it.</p>

                                    <h2 class="major">Marxism - a Modern Utopia?</h2>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p><em>Originally written for the H.G. Wells Society newsletter in 2016 (when I was 14 and did not know how to reference properly)</em></p>
<p>1905 was an incredibly exciting time to be contemplating the future. The 19th century had been a century of immense change, and as it drew to a close, a number of emergent ideas about humanity had to be integrated into the “intellectual landscape” of the world. <em>A Modern Utopia</em> was from the outset an attempt to conceptualise a utopia compatible with the post-Enlightenment, post-Industrial Revolution mode of thought: one compatible with the “modern dreamer” and the age after “Darwin quickened the thought of the world.<a href="#fn:1">1</a></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the developments of the 19th century also spawned innovations in strands of political philosophy which did not proclaim to be utopian, and indeed polemicised against utopianism. One of these, and a hugely influential one at that, was Marxism. Marxism was developed to be a “scientific socialism” in blunt opposition to the now almost extinct utopianism of Owen, Fourier and others, and its task “was no longer to manufacture a system of society as perfect as possible, but to examine the historico-economic succession of events.”<a href="#fn:2">2</a> In other words, the modern, Marxist-influenced socialist currents are characterised by the very fact that they are not utopian. Yet even so, socialists are routinely accused of “utopianism.” To an extent, everyone with a desire to improve society has the same end goal as utopians: “the essay into a better future.”<a href="#fn:3">3</a> But although where to draw the line between being radical and being utopian is still a point of contention, this essay shall attempt to compare the society envisaged in <em>A Modern Utopia</em> with the communist vision and use the standards Wells set to establish the extent of the latter’s utopianism.</p>
<p>As would be expected given the similar goals of all visionaries, there are several similarities between the two societies. Most of these similarities, however, stem not from a shared utopianism, but from a shared progressivism; that is, the fact that both communism and Wells’ utopian vision involve taking some aspects of modern society and extending them further as opposed to erasing them and replacing them with older, “correct” methods of social organisation (as reactionaries advocate). This progressivism appears to exist for both Marx and Wells on a theoretical level. Heraclitus, whose ideas on dialectics were resurrected by Hegel and Marx , is quoted as saying that “everything flows and nothing abides”<a href="#fn:4">4</a>, a sentiment echoed by Wells, who writes “There is no abiding thing in what we know.”<a href="#fn:5">5</a> If everything inherently changes and progresses, society must change accordingly, and therefore a desirable or utopian vision of a society must be neither regressive nor static, “but kinetic.”<a href="#fn:6">6</a> This theoretical commonality gives rise to practical commonalities.</p>
<p>The most obvious “progressive” feature held in common by the two societies on a practical level is the transformation of social relations and liberation of humanity by technological advancement. This is fundamental to Marxism. Historical materialism is in essence the notion that a continuous process of development of productive forces causes different systems of economic organisation (and corresponding political systems) to emerge and die out at each stage of development: the notion that “the hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist.”<a href="#fn:7">7</a> It is never explicitly said that technological development itself would solve the contradictions in capitalism, but the socialist/communist society does “presuppose a level of development of the productive forces of society”, as well as of “the productivity of social labour”, which will provide overabundance of goods.<a href="#fn:8">8</a></p>
<p>Similarly, in <em>A Modern Utopia</em>, the idea of using technology as an emancipatory force, since “the social fabric rests no longer upon human labour”<a href="#fn:9">9</a>, is thoroughly embraced. An even clearer parallel with Marxism is the connection which Wells immediately makes between technological advancement and “abolishing the last base reason for anyone’s servitude or inferiority”<a href="#fn:10">10</a>, stating that due to “the new conditions physical science is bringing about…a labouring class… will become unnecessary to the world of men.”<a href="#fn:11">11</a> This “class of workers without personal initiative”<a href="#fn:12">12</a> is none other than the proletariat, the very class upon whose abolition of “itself as proletariat”<a href="#fn:13">13</a> communism is predicated.</p>
<p>There are also some similarities between the societies in the social sphere, but as with the economic similarities, many of these can be are reducible to the essential progressivism which these two societies share.</p>
<p>The 19th century was the one during which globalisation really took off; and when <em>A Modern Utopia</em> was written, this showed no signs of ending. It was probably around this time that progressivism became so closely linked to internationalism. The final line of <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>, “Workers of the world, unite!” epitomises the Marxist belief that no less than a planet would serve the purpose of communism, just as “no less than a planet would serve the purpose of a modern utopia.”<a href="#fn:14">14</a> Wells notes that “the whole trend of modern thought is against the permanence of such enclosures [as nation-states]”<a href="#fn:15">15</a> – and therefore towards the inverse: something similar to the “global republic of labour” of socialist theory. In a modern utopia, much as in a borderless communism, “the whole world will be open and accessible and…habituated to the coming and going of strangers.”<a href="#fn:16">16</a></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the social realm, we find some statements on the matters of child-rearing, sex/gender and race which would not have looked out of place in First International documents. In the Modern Utopia, “for all purposes of the individual, women are to be as free as men. This will certainly be realised in the Modern Utopia if it can be realised at all – not only for women’s sake but for man’s”<a href="#fn:17">17</a> and different races will “intermingle pretty freely.”<a href="#fn:18">18</a> In the same vein, the French Workers’ Party wrote in 1880 that “the emancipation of the productive class is that of all human beings without distinction of sex or race.”<a href="#fn:19">19</a> Utopia will even have “increasing control of a child’s welfare and upbringing by the community”<a href="#fn:20">20</a> which is reminiscent of the famous communist notion of the sublation of the family and “[replacement of] home education by social”<a href="#fn:21">21</a></p>
<p>That seems to be where the similarities end. As you may have noticed, these similarities all apply to the outlines of communist and Utopian society, and not to the actual methods of socioeconomic organisation – which are nothing alike. Despite ostensibly being based on “the hypothesis of the complete emancipation of a community of men from tradition”<a href="#fn:22">22</a>, the modern Utopia is a slightly tweaked but still probably feasible version of capitalism, ensconced in traditional beliefs about humanity. The clearest example of this is the postulation that since “money is…a necessary thing in civilised human life”<a href="#fn:23">23</a> there will be no “free demand of commodities from a central store” due to the “inherent moral dross in man.”<a href="#fn:24">24</a> This is a variant of the human nature argument, an argument often accompanied by accusations of utopianism. Surely, someone trying to create a utopia, a “most distinctly impracticable” world<a href="#fn:25">25</a> which is free of traditional thinking and organisation would not refer to such a bastion of philosophical orthodoxy? And surely, if this utopian society takes human nature and thereby practicability into account, it is not so utopian.</p>
<p>This is not the only example of practicability which we see in the modern utopia. The <em>samurai,</em> the voluntary elite of Utopian society, are said to carry out “the whole of the responsible rule of the world”<a href="#fn:26">26</a> , to be responsible for such tasks as “legislation* and employment* of* labour”<em>,</em> and it is argued that this legislation is needed because “we should certainly not be free to kill, assault or threaten anyone we met”<a href="#fn:27">27</a>, showing that there is of course a state in this utopia and implying that people kill, assault and threaten others out of some kind of abstract desire which cannot even be changed in a utopia. And although “there is no private fortune in the whole world that is more than a little thing beside the wealth of the State”<a href="#fn:28">28</a>, “besides…shares in business adventures, Utopia will no doubt permit associations of its citizens to have a property in various sorts of contracts and concessions.”<a href="#fn:29">29</a> So Utopia has private ownership of some means of production, a state and a market system with money and commodity circulation. The communist society, in which “the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and the direction of the processes of production…the state is not “abolished”, it withers away”<a href="#fn:30">30</a>, market exchange is replaced by economic planning and “human nature” is not taken into account, is thus <em>further away</em> from capitalist society and from what is considered practicable than a deliberate exercise in utopianism!</p>
<p>This seems to indicate that communism is but another modern utopia. However, it is important to note that this comparison has measured “practicability” exclusively in terms of “similarity to current society.” Although there is no other way to measure practicability without resorting to speculation, this does mean that writing off communism completely would not be justified at this point in time, since by this logic, absolutely any revolutionary idea in history could have been called utopian before being put into practice. Communism, given favourable material conditions, could still potentially prove itself. The impossibility of objectively measuring its utopianism just shows that the term “utopianism” is, and always will be, subject to ideological manipulation.</p>

                                    <h2 class="major">Power Dynamics and Sexuality</h2>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p><em>An essay originally written for an exam in 2018, on <em>Lolita</em> and <em>The Bloody Chamber.</em> For an exam essay, I am unreasonably proud of this one. (Apparently it also marks my discovery of MLA?)</em></p>
<p>“In a good short story”, wrote Greg Hollingshead in 1999, “the meaning is not so abstractable, so portable, as it must be in a novel, but is rather more tightly and ineffably embodied in the formal details of the text.” (Hollingshead 878) A scene in a short story operates with “centripetal force”: self- contained, focused inwards, seeking to embody within every detail of its constituent text the meaning its author wishes to convey. In contrast, the energy of a scene in a novel is centrifugal. There is a qualitative difference between a line of short stories strung together and a novel, in that each scene in a novel must look forward and backwards, connecting antecedents to consequents, leading up to and concluding its climax rather than <em>being</em> that climax.</p>
<p>This difference in form clearly manifests itself in the presentation of power dynamics within sexuality by Nabokov and Carter. Carter has affirmed her fondness of “Gothic tales, cruel tales, tales of wonder, tales of terror […] mirrors; the externalized self; forsaken castles; haunted forests; forbidden sexual objects” (Wisker 178), and many of these elements can be seen in <em>The Bloody Chamber</em>, which can therefore be read as a Gothic tale; a tale deliberately constructed to provoke terror (Farima 1). The genre to which <em>Lolita</em> belongs has a far less defined purpose; McHale characterises it as “the last of Nabokov’s modernist novels” (McHale 90), being organised according to “an epistemological dominant” as opposed to an ontological one. True to the modernist canon, the unreliability of Humbert Humbert as a narrator and his eloquent and beguiling use of language leave the reader facing a conundrum over how to react to him: whether to sympathise with his somehow appealing character or be disgusted by the obvious repugnance of his actions. Consequently, while both power dynamics presented begin with a similar outline – virile, powerful older man sexually attracted to innocent, virginal younger girl – <em>The Bloody Chamber’s</em> self-containment as a short story lends itself well to the Gothic objective of raw horror, while <em>Lolita</em>, a novel, creates a more subtle, less decisive sense of unease in the reader’s mind.</p>
<p>One of the most immediately noticeable aspects of this similarity in outline is the commonalities between the two dominant male characters’ sexual tastes, and their connection to certain aspects of the characters’ personalities. From the outset, Humbert is portrayed to the reader as attractive, sophisticated and, above all, masculine: “Let me repeat with quiet force: I was, and still am, despite mes malheurs, an exceptionally handsome male […] Exceptional virility often reflects in the subject’s displayable features a sullen and congested something that pertains to what he has to conceal.” (Nabokov 25) The very way he expresses these traits of his reaffirms his possession of them, from the imperative “let me repeat” and the association of quiet force with the ‘strong and silent’ male ideal, to the exotic sprinkling of mysterious French words (“mes malheurs”), to the brooding intelligence insinuated by the generalisation “the subject’s displayable features.”</p>
<p>In the same vein, the Marquis is so masculine as to be “leonine”, and the narrator takes care to describe the characteristics which contribute to his dominance over her. The idea that “though he was a big man, he moved as softly […] as if his footfall turned the carpet into snow” (Carter 2) simultaneously highlights his masculine proportions and the almost magical quality of his mystique, demonstrated by a simile describing an act of transfiguration, while the pairing of a repeated comparative and an intensifier (“He was older than I. He was much older than I,”) explicitly relate his age to his power over the narrator, i.e. his ‘more-than’ relative to her. She wonders why he chose her and speculates that “as if to demonstrate the eclecticism of his taste, he had invited me to join this gallery of beautiful women” (3) using the connotations of variety and plentitude supplied by “gallery” and the freedom of an invitation to communicate his utter control over the matter. Humbert has just as much freedom to choose who he has sex with; women risk “toppling, bloodripe, into [his] cold lap.” (Nabokov 25) “Toppling” suggests an involuntary action, just as “cold” implies unwillingness; the mutual unwillingness emphasised by this counterposition shows that Humbert attracts women with not just minimal, but negative effort. Thus both men are masculine, mysterious and entirely in control sexually.</p>
<p>The absolute dominance resulting from these traits makes these men’s desires for particularly vulnerable women more striking examples of a sexual preference for acting as subjugator. To an extent, both Nabokov and Carter could be argued to have expressly depicted sadomasochistic relationships, in which at least one partner gains sexual satisfaction from being on one side of an evident power imbalance. This depiction may not have been entirely conscious since not much was publicly known at the time of writing about such preferences. However, the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual formally established the link between sadomasochism and infantilism, stating that one party in a sadomasochistic relationship may “be treated as a helpless infant” (DSM-IV 572) as an additional dimension to the power dynamic. The modern reader may therefore interpret the texts with this context in mind.</p>
<p>In <em>Lolita</em>, of course, even infantilised adults – Valeria with her way of dressing “à la gamine” (girlishly)<a href="#fn:1">1</a> (Nabokov 26) or Rita with “the oddly prepubescent curve of her back” (257) - do not satisfy Humbert’s lust for children themselves. Every facet of Lolita’s prepubescence stirs passion in him; throughout the novel, he uses epithets which accentuate various aspects of her youth, for instance “brown, naked, frail Lo” (137), “little limp Lo!” (157) and “my little concubine who was now sixty inches tall and weighed ninety pounds” (206). In the first example, a tricolon of adjectives all linked to exposure and (hence) vulnerability reinforce each other’s messages; in the second, the alliteration of sensual lateral consonants emphasises Humbert’s delight in playing with the sound of Lolita’s name (and thus the very notion of her). By mentioning Lolita’s height and weight in the third example, he draws attention to the physically diminutive stature which complements her mental youth, which is emphasised once more by the word “little”, rendered sexual when coupled with “concubine.” In ancient Rome, <em>concubini</em> were child slaves sexually abused by their masters; this historical significance adds to the exploitative implications of this word choice.</p>
<p>Though <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> does not go as far as overt paedophilia, the Marquis does display paraphilic traits through his fetishisation of the narrator’s youth and innocence, which is even conveyed using epithets resembling Humbert’s. He addresses her as “my little nun”, proceeding to comment mockingly “Baby musn’t play with grown-ups’ toys until she has learnt how to handle them, musn’t she?” (Carter 6) Whereas Nabokov juxtaposes “little” with the sexual connotations of “councubine”, Carter does the opposite by attributing the adjective to “nun”, a word which contrastingly hints at pudicity. Pudicity is still semantically connected to sexuality, in that it is the denial of overt sexuality, but can still be seen as a sexually desirable attribute for women (and has been seen as such in many societies). Thus despite using essentially an antonym of ‘concubine’, Carter retains a similar link between ‘littleness’ and sexuality. Indeed, the entirety of <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> arguably fits into this pattern of exposing the hidden, frequently forgotten sexual elements within certain ideas. Bacchilega writes that “Carter turned to the fairy tale, because of its latent sexuality, in order to lure – rather than force – women into reassessing our relationship to sexuality.” (Bacchilega 18). Just as the common trope of the innocent, younger woman with “a potentiality for corruption” (Carter 3) has sexual, even sadomasochistic undertones, so does the genre of the fairy tale itself, and Carter uses these choices of trope and genre to bring these latent undertones to the forefront of her narrative.</p>
<p>Alongside the idea of childishness is that of inexperience, either in the general sense of a lack of knowledge caused by a lack of life experience, or sexual inexperience – i.e. virginity – more specifically. The Marquis appears to relish the idea that certain things are out of reach to the narrator of <em>The Bloody Chamber</em>, whether this be physically out of reach, due to her childlike proportions, or incomprehensible to her childlike mind. Without using quotations or otherwise indicating that these are the Marquis’ thoughts, Carter writes “I [the narrator] was only a little girl, I did not understand.” (6) The fact that there is no such indication suggests that the narrator is indeed in a position of incomprehension, as she has seamlessly absorbed the thoughts of the Marquis such that they have become her own; the force of his authority has altered her view of herself after just one night spent with him. This highlights just how much control he has over her mind without her even recognising his exercise of control. His mockery exemplifies this once again: “he dangled the key tantalizingly above my head, out of reach of my straining fingers.” (7) <em>Straining</em>, a present participle implying continuous, considerable effort, means that the narrator is in fact trying hard to attain something which the Marquis is placing out of her reach; in other words, this is a small act of rebellion. Nevertheless, he is deliberately entertaining this rebellion and “tantalising” her in a continuous manner to match her straining. That he is enjoying the futility of her rebellion shows his active enjoyment of his power over her and his ability to prevent her action from coming to fruition.</p>
<p>Humbert likewise enjoys Lolita’s inexperience and his own ability to tame any rebellion she might attempt; he describes her “lovely, lost, inane look” (Nabokov 75), again using the alliteration of lateral consonants, and like the Marquis, he describes even her most exasperating behaviour tenderly. By noting that “a combination of naivete and deception, of charm and vulgarity, of blue sulks and rosy mirth, Lolita…could be a most exasperating brat” (145), he juxtaposes ‘charm’ and ‘rosiness’, words associated with youthful beauty, with her brattish behaviour, thereby connecting them almost causally in the mind of the reader. Although Lolita can be a brat, he sees this as directly related to her most endearing qualities, and even to her innocence. As is typical of sexually dominant partners, he appears to like watching <em>his</em> Lolita struggle helplessly against his control.</p>
<p>However, the clearest instances of both female characters’ inexperience contributing to both power imbalances presented by these authors involve the taking of their virginity. In both cases, the taking of virginity is defilement; it is carnal consumption, and the two dominant men are the consumers. This is not unusual given the well-established English literary tradition of portraying virginity as “something for sole possession” and its loss as “personal destruction” (Chen 89), but these particular portrayals of virginity as such are integral to the power dynamics established by Nabokov and Carter. Humbert and the Marquis both use gustatory language to refer to the defilement of their virgin lovers. The former refers to “her innocent mouth melting under the ferocious pressure of dark male jaws” (Nabokov 66), using the notions of melting and pressure applied by jaws to liken his discreet sexual advances to the consumption of food, and establishing himself using synecdoche as the supremely masculine owner of the “dark male jaws.” He later uses the verb “gorge” (“gorge the limp nymphet” (80)), which has similar connotations of consumption, coupling it with a reference to the “limp”, helpless object of this verb.</p>
<p>The Marquis’ use of language in this gustatory semantic field also has the purpose of illustrating his power over and dehumanisation – hence “personal destruction” - of the object of his consumption. “He stripped me, gourmand that he was, as if he were stripping the leaves off an artichoke–but do not imagine much finesse about it; this artichoke was no particular treat for the diner nor was he yet in any greedy haste” (Carter 5) suggests a certain vulgarity through the crude term “stripped” and the overtly mentioned lack of finesse, as if he is roughly cutting her up as he would a vegetable. The juxtaposition of “gourmand”, implying luxury, and “stripped”, implying crudeness, renders this description slightly ironic.</p>
<p>Nabokov conveys the destruction inherent to a girl’s ‘deflowering’ using a sort of praeteritio; when Humbert takes Lolita’s virginity, he deliberately avoids explicit reference to any carnality and uses spiritually-toned language to give the impression of distance from such things. “I am not concerned</p>
<p>with <em>so</em>-called sex at all […] A great endeavour lures me on: to fix once and for all the perilous magic of nymphets,” (Nabokov 133), with words reminiscent of fantasy such as “endeavour”, “lure”, “perilous” and “magic”, creates the sense that Humbert desires the exact opposite of mere bodily pleasures; on the contrary, he is on a great quest bordering on the immaterial and magical. The concept of “fixing once and for all” roots this quest firmly in the power dynamic he seeks to establish, since it has a sense of finality – the final quashing of any resistance - and could be applied to an object rather than a person. Hence through the loss of her virginity, Lolita ceases to exist as a person and becomes purely Humbert’s nymphet: an object defined by its sexual employment.</p>
<p>Although the pure carnality of Carter’s style contrasts sharply with this, Carter ultimately creates a similar impression of the Marquis’ wish to crush the submissive party’s resistance, and her personhood. This is hinted at by the way in which the narrator almost seems to have an out-of-body experience as her virginity is taken, slipping into third person: “A dozen husbands impaled a dozen brides while the mewing gulls swung on invisible trapezes in the empty air outside.” (Carter 6) The violence of the verb “impale” paired with the surreal notions of invisible trapezes and husbands and wives ‘multiplying’ creates the idea that the narrator has been violently jerked out of her person and transformed into something less real: a spectacle which she is forced to watch from a third person perspective. This is compounded by her remark “Yet I had been infinitely dishevelled by the loss of my virginity”, which befits the idea that the loss of virginity constitutes defilement, and that hers was taken in a coarse, rough, destructive manner. Unlike Humbert, however, the narrator of <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> makes no secret of the physical violence implicated in this defilement. For her, it is a crucial part of the act, not just banality that “anyone can imagine.” (Nabokov 133) Humbert’s use of an indefinite pronoun implies his own personal dissociation from the act; a dissociation which would be unlikely to exist if the novel were narrated, as <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> is, by the victim of the violence.</p>
<p>A final similarity between the power dynamics presented by Nabokov and Carter is the ‘artistic’ qualities of both Humbert’s and the Marquis’ lust for their young lovers. These men are both aesthetes, for whom sexual pleasure is in part derived from the artistic form with which it is <em>presented</em>. In the mid to late 20th century, when both works were written, French was the language of high culture and diplomacy. English only became an official language of the European Economic Community in 1973 (just 6 years before <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> was published), and so at the time of writing, English had not yet supplanted French as the language of the cultured global elite in the eyes of Europeans. Therefore the Frenchisms adorning the speech of both male characters enhance their portrayal as aesthetes. The Marquis intones “Your thin white face, <em>chérie.</em> Your thin white face…” (Carter 7), where the French apostrophe adds to the rhythmic, poetic impression provided by the anaphora, associating the apostrophised narrator with culture and art.</p>
<p>Humbert speaks similarly on several occasons throughout <em>Lolita</em>, but perhaps the most noteworthy instance is “Poor Bluebeard. Those brutal brothers. <em>Est-ce que tu ne m’aimes plus, ma Carmen</em> ?”<a href="#fn:2">2</a> (Nabokov 241) As well as a French epithet, rendered proprietorial by the possessive pronoun <em>ma</em>, Humbert refers to two artworks here: the opera and novella <em>Carmen</em> and, remarkably, the French folk story <em>Bluebeard -</em> of which <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> is a retelling. By invoking art and relating the romance of Humbert and Lolita to it, Nabokov distances their romance one step further from reality; Humbert’s attraction to Lolita is hence no longer the sexual exploitation of a minor, but the abstract enjoyment of an aesthetic ideal.*</p>
<p>This contrasts greatly with the aforementioned raw violence involved when the narrator of <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> is <em>impaled</em> as her virginity is taken. Like Lolita, she is reduced to an “image” within the artistic paradigm in which the Marquis conceptualises her. “I saw in the mirror the living image of an etching by Rops he had shown me” (Carter 5) suggests that his own artistic tastes, which she has become acquainted with, are informing and redefining her view of herself (with the mirror here symbolising her sense of self). Yet this reduction does not lessen the materiality of the sexual violence inflicted upon her. On the contrary, the pornographic attributes of every piece of art mentioned in <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> – from Rops’ art, commonly associated with the most lascivious of proto-Symbolist poetry (Holtzmann 103), to books with such euphemistic titles as “<em>The Initiation, The Key of Mysteries, The Secret of Pandora’s Box”</em> (Carter 5) - lead to a sense that the Marquis’ specific aesthetic ideal is vulgar and corrupt. Rather than using aesthetic concepts to ‘immaterialise’ the submissive party and draw attention away from the morally problematic aspect of their relationship, Carter uses them to further highlight the Marquis’ corruption and destruction of the narrator and her personhood. Her transformation into an image does not augment her being, as it does for Lolita, whose “Botticellian pink” aesthetic (Nabokov 64) immortalises her as “the eternal Lolita” (65); it diminishes it. The reader is not to pity the Bluebeard of <em>The Bloody Chamber</em>; this Bluebeard is not tortured by an immortal, nymphoid beauty.*</p>
<p>We can already see from the different ways in which Carter and Nabokov use the idea of aesthetic pleasure that a pattern concerning the nature of the female characters’ subjugation is emerging. Even though Humbert is in a position of power over Lolita, as has been established in this essay, the high artistic esteem in which he holds her elevates her status such that he is perhaps not the only party exercising power in his relationship with her. An intriguing Freudian interpretation arises from this observation. As well as infantilising Lolita while simultaneously elevating her through her representation as a pictorial, quasi-immortal ideal, Humbert appears to infantilise <em>himself.</em> Blum writes that the term “adult disguise […] describes simultaneously the adult façade veiling the child and his obsession with the world of girlchildren disguising the adult he is” (Blum 243), hinting that Humbert views himself as a child disguised as an adult, whose true desires are correspondingly those of a child.</p>
<p>This would lend weight to a reading of Humbert as inverse-Oedipal figure: an adult who never conquered his Oedipus complex and therefore, paradoxically, construes Lolita as the ‘mother’ and her mother Charlotte as the ‘father’ who must be removed in order for Oedipus-Humbert to be the sole object of Lolita’s desire. When Charlotte dies, Humbert refers to “when Charlotte had been eliminated and I re-entered the house a free father” (Nabokov 101); the clinical tone of “eliminated” implies that Humbert had a strategic interest in Charlotte’s death, just as an Oedipal character would strategically plan for the death of his father. The ironic mention of Humbert’s own status as father possibly shows that Nabokov has intentionally inverted the Oedipus complex to apply it to a perversely juvenile adult. This inversion also highlights one respect in which Lolita, as the ‘mother’ in this triad, exercises power over him.</p>
<p>For the majority of the novel, Humbert views love solipsistically. Near the start, he is always at the spatial centre of his relationships with nymphets; he declares “Let them play around me forever” (21), expressing his desire for nymphets to revolve physically around him, just as they would mentally do so. As the novel progresses, he continues to conceive of his attraction to nymphets in terms of the reaction they elicit in him; he generalises “that is what nymphets imitate, while we moan and die” (120). Only at the end does it become clear that he regrets his romantic solipsism, because contrary to previous impressions the reader may have received, he cares deeply about Lolita. Condemning himself, he almost seems to cry “I was despicable and brutal, and turpid, and everything, <em>mais je t’aimais, je t’aimais</em> !” (283) This polysyndeton intensifies his self-condemnation and the impression that he is rapidly losing self-control, while the repetition of <em>je t’aimais</em> and the use of the French imperfect add the sentimentality of a native tongue to an expression which already conveys profound, continuous, grievous love. The final sentence of the novel - “And this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita” (307) - addresses Lolita using a possessive pronoun, as Humbert has done many times, but with added tenderness as the reader knows that the pair is irrevocably separated by death. The sincerity of Humbert’s love for Lolita is another way in which, despite his dominant attributes, she has power over him.</p>
<p><em>The Bloody Chamber</em> is not devoid of tender moments. The point at which the narrator first notices the Marquis’ tinge of vulnerability has such gravity that it is placed on its own line: “And it seemed to me that he was in despair.” (Carter 14) This is a fragment, beginning with “and”, showing that his appearance of despair is not a complete thought as a sentence proper would be; it is contingent. Even when considering the Marquis’ despair, there is an “and”, a shadow of the threat the Marquis always poses. Like Humbert, he apostrophises her using a term of endearment: “‘My little love, you’ll never know how much I hate daylight!&quot; (14) Yet he returns to himself, to his hatred. There is no hint that he laments his neglect to focus on any component of the narrator’s personhood; she is never anything more to him than “virgin of the arpeggios”, an aesthetic ideal, a placeholder for “a dozen more fiancees.” (15) Most significantly, he wants to destroy her. The tricolon “the lustratory ritual and the ceremonial robing: after that, the sacrifice” (15), with the definite article giving an abstract sense to these processes, shows that the Marquis’ aesthetically-motivated idealism – so like Humbert’s, save for its mechanical, ritualistic, wholly destructive end product – follows him to his deathbed practically unchanged. To paraphrase Carter, his character is not altered by experience, but “washed perfectly smooth.”</p>
<p>This is the essential difference between a modernist novel and a Gothic short story. The former has the room, both in terms of its physical length and the necessarily much looser confines of its genre, for the author to add several layers of complexity to how he presents power dynamics within sexuality. A character who at first appears to have absolute dominance can be reduced to ceaseless outpourings of sorrow by a prepubescent orphan, because neither his dominance nor her fragility are absolute; it is the job of the modernist author to invite the reader to consider the fluid, symbiotic power dynamic between these two characters, and to question where their own sympathies lie. To write a Gothic short story, while the author may engage in social commentary, her ultimate purpose is to induce fear. The dominant male figure may have complex and conflicting emotions beneath his imposing exterior, but he may never yield. A character who yields is not fearsome. For this reason, unlike Nabokov’s counterpart, the dominant/submissive power dynamic established by Carter never wavers.</p>

<p>While much of Europe spent the 19th century reshaping its systems of political and economic organisation, an intense intellectual debate in Russia was redefining the very nature of Russian-ness. The legacy of rulers like Peter I and Catherine I, who were responsible for modernising Russia’s courts, overhauling its army and dramatically increasing its foreign influence and artistic prowess, was deeply divisive. Although both of these rulers presided over usually popular developments – most notably military victory during the Great Northern War and Russo-Turkish wars – some of the most striking examples of their repressive leadership were their responses to those who challenged their progressive agenda, including the suppression of the Streltsy Rebellion<a href="#fn:1">1</a> and of around 160 popular uprisings between 1762 and 1772.<a href="#fn:2">2</a> In Russia, modernity did not always seem to have positive connotations.</p>
<p>This battle between decidedly forward-thinking rulers and a vocal chunk of the population who opposed them formed the backdrop against which the Slavophile tradition was born. In contrast to the group of intellectuals known as Westernisers, who, in Riasanovsky’s words, embraced Peter I as “the victorious creator of the Russian empire and its might, the sage organizer of the state, the lawgiver of modern Russia&quot;<a href="#fn:3">3</a>, the group who identified themselves as Slavophiles believed that his reforms were at odds with Russia’s fundamental character. They were prompted to become more vocal in civil discourse by Peter Chaadaev’s controversial <em>Philosophical Letters,</em> published in 1829,* in which he wrote (of Russia):</p>
<p>Isolated in the world, we have given nothing to the world, we have taught nothing to the world; we have not added a single idea to the mass of human ideas; we have contributed nothing to the progress of the human spirit.<a href="#fn:4">4</a></p>
<p>For Chaadaev, Russia’s isolation from the West was to blame for its lack of meaningful progress; “[Russians] have never moved in concert with other peoples” and so “the universal education of mankind has not touched us.”<a href="#fn:5">5</a> The Slavophiles’ response was that realising this separation from Western Europe by establishing a form of social organisation based on their own traditions was exactly what would improve Russia, rather than seeking to imitate a foreign model.<a href="#fn:6">6</a> They regarded the West as decadent and morally inferior; to them, Western people “were guilty of a multitude of sins. Egoism, communism, rationalism, sensuality, pride, affectation, superficiality, cruelty, bellicosity, exploitation, luxury, deceptiveness, rapacity, treachery, lechery, corruption, and decay were among</p>
<p>“Their” attributes.”<a href="#fn:7">7</a> Given that communism was included in this list of sins, it might seem obvious that socialist realism cannot be considered part of the Slavophile tradition. To Slavophiles, socialist realism would have been viewed as a product of Western thought due to its aim of promoting communist ideology – indeed, Solzhenitsyn did criticise communism as the imposition of an alien, Western system on Russia.<a href="#fn:8">8</a> Meanwhile, socialist realists thought of their work as a new stage in artistic evolution – just as communism was a new stage in societal evolution – as opposed to the return to traditional ways championed by Slavophiles.<a href="#fn:9">9</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, we have already seen one similarity between the two schools of thought: the socialist government, and therefore the artwork it sanctioned, shared the Slavophiles’ disdain for Western societies (in this case, because they were bastions of bourgeois capitalism). Moreover, according to Dobrenko, this disdain was part of a conservative, even nationalist desire to create a “properly Russian, egalitarian, pseudo- collectivist, anti-market, anti-bourgeois, anti-Western […] socialist utopia”<a href="#fn:10">10</a> which existed alongside support for rapid industrialisation and the notion of proletarian internationalism. Thus, even though socialist realism was supposedly an entirely new, revolutionary style of art distinct from previous ‘bourgeois’ art, running through its Russian incarnation were echoes of a century-old duality: the coexistence of a muted admiration of Western liberal technocracy and an instinctive repulsion by it. To examine this further, this essay will compare the key values and the portrayal of Russia and Russians which can be seen in the ideas of Slavophiles and socialist realists, in order to determine to what extent socialist realism was simply a red-tinted continuation of Slavophilia.</p>
<p>According to Slavophiles, the moral decay of Western Europe was rooted in its adoption of inferior forms of Christianity. Their opposition to Westernisation could in part be reduced to a belief that the Russian Orthodox Church had a special place in Russian history, and that emulating Western mores which were informed by Catholicism would corrupt the uniquely Orthodox character of Russia.<a href="#fn:11">11</a> In fact, any authority which attempted to place itself above the Church in the hierarchy of Russian society was automatically opposed by Slavophiles, including the government of Nicholas I – which, despite its official mantra of ’Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality’, prioritised autocracy over orthodoxy and aimed to render the Church subordinate to the state.<a href="#fn:12">12</a> Immediately, the central position of religion in Slavophile ideas appears to set it apart from socialist realism; a movement with the goal of developing a secular, proletarian culture surely could not be part of a tradition with the goal of restoring the hegemony of religious authority. As well as this obvious difference in values, the reasoning behind Slavophiles’ opposition to Western styles of governance reveals another difference between them and socialist realists. The concept of moral decay is at odds with ’scientific socialism.’ Engels wrote in <em>Anti-Dühring</em> that:</p>
<p>We therefore reject every attempt to impose on us any moral dogma whatsoever as an eternal, ultimate and forever immutable ethical law on the pretext that the moral world, too, has its permanent principles which stand above history and the differences between nations. We maintain on the contrary that all moral theories have been hitherto the product, in the last analysis, of the economic conditions of society obtaining at the time. And as society has hitherto moved in class antagonisms, morality has always been class morality; it has either justified the domination and the interests of the ruling class, or ever since the oppressed class became powerful enough, it has represented its indignation against this domination and the future interests of the oppressed.<a href="#fn:13">13</a></p>
<p>Socialists therefore support the furthest thing possible from a permanent religious authority whose close relationship to Russian identity gives it an unquestionable right to the highest power in Russia. They reject any idea of morality on the grounds that it necessarily reflects ruling class ideology, and so for them, the defects of Western systems of government do not lie in an inherent moral corruption but in the specific class antagonisms within those systems at a certain point in time.</p>
<p>While not based on ethical propositions, however, socialist criticisms had another objective basis: the historical materialist theory of social history. Dialectical and historical materialism are characterised by their rather bold claim to have formulated a set of laws by which societal development invariably unfolds. Tellingly, in his 1938 publication <em>Dialectical and Historical Materialism</em>, Stalin (socialist realism’s biggest sponsor) stresses the ostensibly objective and scientific nature of the theory, referring multiple times to the ‘laws’ of social history and the idea that “the <em>science</em> of the history of society can become <em>as precise a science</em> as, let us say, biology”<a href="#fn:14">14</a> (italics added). That Russian socialists were so quick to embrace the purported objectivity of Marxist analysis suggests that they had an appetite for such objectivity, and sought scientific justification for it in the absence of religion. Slavophiles’ advocacy of the supremacy of religious authority based on unchanging cultural and ethical values represented a deep-seated conservative morality; socialist realists, although they replaced this authority and these values with ’progressive’ ones, retained their veneration of the immutable.</p>
<p>The subject of authority is another area with more commonalities than there initially seem to be. Both Slavophiles and socialists are associated with authoritarianism, but their attitudes towards authority are more nuanced and contingent than blindly reverential. In Slavophile thought, an ideal Russian state would use autocratic methods to enforce traditional values. However, any state which did not uphold truly Russian principles would be viewed with suspicion by Slavophiles, who believed that authoritarianism was often connected to the imposition of alien values on the Russian people.<a href="#fn:15">15</a> This was the kernel of their aforementioned dispute with Nicholas I, a ruler who superficially shared many of their values. Socialist ideology likewise does not contain the slightest hint of unconditional respect for authority. On the contrary, it encourages insurrection against oppressive bourgeois governments, of the sort that Stalin’s government funded (most significantly through their backing of the PSUC during the Spanish Civil War) and ultimately supports a society in which the state has ’withered away.’ Both Lenin and Stalin made it very clear that although the end goal was a stateless society, a strong proletarian state would be desirable. As Lenin wrote (and Stalin quoted):</p>
<p>The dictatorship of the proletariat is the rule—unrestricted by law and based on force—of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, a rule enjoying the sympathy and support of the labouring and exploited masses.<a href="#fn:16">16</a></p>
<p>In addition, “the dictatorship of the proletariat does not differ fundamentally from the dictatorship of any other class.”<a href="#fn:17">17</a> Therefore, just as the bourgeoisie or nobility coercively suppressed other classes under capitalism and feudalism, the proletariat would do the same and be justified in doing so. Slavophilic conditional authoritarianism shows why this view of authority might have been easy to digest in Russia; Russians were used to the basic notion that autocracy was not inherently preferable, but the right kind of autocratic government was worth respecting.</p>
<p>Socialist realist art put this take on authority into practice during Stalin’s premiership. A lesser-known conflict between Slavophiles and Westernisers during the 19th century</p>
<p>concerns how to bridge the divide between elite and mass culture: Westernisers maintained that the intellectual level of the masses needed to be raised to that of the intelligentsia, whereas Slavophiles favoured simplifying literature to ‘bring it to the people.’<a href="#fn:18">18</a> The intention of socialist realists was not to bridge this divide, but to transcend it.<a href="#fn:19">19</a> This implies a different sort of discontinuity between Slavophilic and socialist realist ideas: as socialists might have argued, the reason behind the reproduction of certain Slavophile ideas in socialist realism could be the sublation of pre-socialist debates entailed by the proletarian revolution, which would mean that socialist realism is part of a new tradition with a few lingering vestiges of the culture which preceded it. However, socialist realists employed a particular top-down style of stimulating mass cultural engagement which had more than a little in common with the Slavophilic populist-authoritarian hybrid.</p>
<p>The first similarity between the two relates to the regulation of artistic expression in the Soviet Union under Stalin. The picture we often have in the West of the arts in the Soviet Union is one of tightly-controlled, Marxist conformism, where every brushstroke and every comma must sing a song of eternal proletarian glory. Of course, there was censorship and a certain degree of <em>partiinost’</em> to which the cultural intelligentsia had to conform, but since artists were not required to be party members, the orthodoxies of pre- Soviet art and literature were allowed to filter through into socialist consciousness just as socialist values filtered into the work of the former ‘bourgeois’ intelligentsia. Rather than being dominated by Marxism, creative output under Stalin was dominated by an overarching conservatism, which gave artists immense impetus to conform not only to the orthodoxy of socialist realism but also to imitate the artists of the past who were afforded the greatest respect: Pushkin in poetry, Stanislavsky in theatre, the Itinerants (19th century Russian realists) in painting.<a href="#fn:20">20</a> Thus, although one of the stated objectives of socialist realism was to create a new art style which was accessible and relevant to workers,<a href="#fn:21">21</a> they did so by appealing to traditional Russian artistic convention and strongly promoting conformity to it. The restrictive environment which came to exist as a result bore little resemblance to the revolutionary futurism which flourished immediately after the 1917 revolutions, and seems more like the return to tradition welcomed by Slavophiles.</p>
<p>The second similarity lies in the innate authoritarianism of the art style itself. As Stalin consolidated his grip on power, the fourth tenet of socialist realism agreed on at the Congress of 1934 – portraying the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its mission in a positive light<a href="#fn:22">22</a> - increasingly developed into the near-deification of Stalin as a person. A famous example is <em>Under the Banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin</em>, created by Gustav Klutsis in 1935 using photomontage:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Aspose.Words.20ec32c2-ceab-4bce-80a4-c55275f39206.001.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This poster contains many of the defining features of socialist realist art. The background is an unmistakeably industrial setting divided into four sections, of which the first three show struggle and revolution, while the fourth shows a crowd of beaming workers, appearing to be marching forward. Photomontage has been used to superimpose the heads of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin onto the scene, on a red banner, as if they were watching over the victorious workers below them. The symbolism of the chimneys and the crowd are obvious: the poster is heralding the victory of the industrial proletariat and emphasising the collective nature of class struggle and progress towards communism.</p>
<p>This is not an image of perfect equality, though. The depiction of the four Marxist leaders is typical of the artistic methods used to foster Stalin’s personality cult: their positioning above the crowd and at the centre of the image gives the impression that they are to be respected, and out of the four, Stalin stands out for being the only forward-facing head. The other three leaders are looking in his direction, as if looking towards the communist future he represents, and directly beneath his gaze is a large group of workers unified by their smiling faces and their implied forward motion. This poster is not about the proletariat as a whole, or the revolution as a whole, or the goal of a free and equal society; it is about the line of great communist leaders whose climax was Stalin, and how Stalin continued and deepened the legacy of his predecessors by ensuring the happiness of the masses pictured below him. In other words, this poster is a paean to authority. Ironically, socialist realists’ efforts to create a proletarian culture involved more conservatism and more leader-worship than ever, bringing to mind the peculiarly authoritarian brand of populism so beloved of Slavophiles.</p>
<p>The final aspect of this comparison between Slavophiles and socialist realists is the ends of each movement: the kind of society, and indeed the kind of individual, which Slavophiles and socialist realists strove to form and regarded as the pinnacle of human capability. Even in this area, there appear to be some glaring similarities between the ideologies. As ever, the ideal society envisaged by Slavophiles displays a characteristic ambiguity concerning the question of the state. The original Russian method of sociopolitical organisation, free from any Western influences, was said to have been a harmonious, co-operative and peaceful peasant commune (<em>mir</em> or <em>obshchina</em>), in which there existed no coercion and “a natural and moral fraternity [among Russians].”<a href="#fn:23">23</a> A lack of coercion, of course, implies the lack of a state apparatus. This anarchistic concept of a network of stateless, freely- associated communes defined by their Russian quality is not dissimilar to the communist vision. Marx and Engels describe the formation of a society without political power in <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>:*</p>
<p>When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. […] In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.<a href="#fn:24">24</a></p>
<p>It is important to note that this society without class distinctions was theoretically the aesthetic ideal of socialist realism, given that one purpose of socialist realism was to provide a positive, hopeful depiction of the direction of social progress.<a href="#fn:25">25</a> Even the nationalism of the Slavophiles’ outlook, which prized communal organisation by virtue of its Russian-ness, could be seen to some extent in socialist realist doctrine. Art was required to be “national in form, Socialist in content”, particularly after World War 2, when patriotic allegiance to the Soviet Union was combined with allegiance to the communist mission in order to win over citizens of the new Eastern Bloc.<a href="#fn:26">26</a></p>
<p>The motive of winning people over provided much of the impetus behind the cultural recycling responsible for socialist realism’s conservative undertones. Cultural recycling is the process of imbuing familiar symbols with new meanings, to communicate a new idea using symbols which already have positive associations. Often, socialism was the new idea, while Orthodox icons were the familiar symbols. Dmitry Moor’s <em>Christmas</em> (1921) is an example:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Aspose.Words.20ec32c2-ceab-4bce-80a4-c55275f39206.002.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Moor was firmly on the realist side of the realism vs. abstraction debate of the early 1920s, and as well as exemplifying early realism, this poster clearly uses traditional Russian symbolism. Transfiguration, in Russian Orthodoxy, involves a halo or rays of light shining down on a person or object to bestow divine sanction upon them, and is evoked by the depiction of light rays shining down on the field. As transfiguration represents divinely-sanctioned legitimacy and the sun represents salvation through Christ, the red star placed (tellingly) over the sun and the rays it emits represent salvation through revolution and the blessing given to workers to carry out their ‘holy’ mission. Due to cultural recycling, many quintessentially Russian motifs were incorporated into socialist realism, giving it – in a sense – the Russian-ness to which Slavophiles aspired. Though such similarities exist, for the most part, the idealised society of socialist realist art was not a descendant of the Russian peasant commune. Socialist realism gives an impression of rigidity, of having one constant party line which must always be followed, and this makes it easy to forget that this art movement is laden with contradictions - as the ideas of its originators frequently were. Though the Communist Party did promote ‘Russification’ in the 1930s, seeking to unite the disparate nationalities within Soviet borders under a common, <em>Soviet</em> identity and language as war approached, it was always careful to distance ‘Soviet patriotism’ from the bourgeois Russian nationalism it roundly condemned. Russians were not praised for their innate spiritual purity, but for having led the international proletariat by carrying out the first revolution.<a href="#fn:27">27</a> The hope was that the rest of the global proletariat would join the Russians to form an international communist society, and when this happened, Russia would not be superior in any way. Unlike Slavophilic patriotism, this patriotism was transient, with the pursuit of international ends in mind.</p>
<p>Moreover, far from creating backward yet wholly Russian peasant communes, Soviet leaders desperately wanted to bring their country in line with the industrialisation levels of Western Europe. The ideal Soviet citizen was not a peasant, but an industrial proletarian, working hard to make his country more modern and productive.<a href="#fn:28">28</a> Socialist realism reflects this appetite for modernisation using romanticised industrial settings. The poster below (left), <em>Help Build the Gigantic Factories</em> (Mirzoyan and Ivanov, 1929), advertises the first Five Year Plan and the heavy industrialisation it called for by portraying industry as beautiful and its construction as a glorious, collaborative effort. Industrial imagery was even used on fabric prints such as Golubev’s <em>Red Spinner</em> (right), designed in 1930.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Aspose.Words.20ec32c2-ceab-4bce-80a4-c55275f39206.003.png" alt=""><img src="/images/Aspose.Words.20ec32c2-ceab-4bce-80a4-c55275f39206.004.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The depiction of industry and technology as not only necessary but <em>beautiful</em> shows how central it was to the socialist realist worldview. This contrasts sharply with Slavophiles’ idealisation of peasant-based societies. Although they opportunistically employed Russian and Orthodox imagery, the society socialist realists strove to create was technologically-advanced, modern and highly efficient, sharing more similarities with the European societies loathed by Slavophiles than with any peasant commune.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that, for all its modernising rhetoric, an idealistic, nationalistic conservatism comparable to Slavophile nostalgia was present in socialist realist thought. However, the opportunistic way in which this conservatism was used to entice formerly religious and patriotic workers, rather than out of any true fidelity to Orthodoxy, advocacy for peasant causes or belief in the inherent supremacy of Russian-ness, indicates that Slavophiles were never truly their ideological progenitor. The relevance of this essay does not come from unearthing a hidden fraternity between two ostensibly opposed schools of thought, but from noting that quasi- Slavophilic ideas have had a unique allure to Russians for centuries. In the 21st century, as an oddly familiar brand of insular traditionalism is used to drum up Russian support for interventionism abroad and autocracy at home, understanding these ideas is the key to understanding Russia itself.</p>

                                    <p><em>Written - as you can probably guess - in 2017.</em></p>
<p>This year, all eyes are on Russia. It is rather fitting that, as the year of the centenaries of its two most famous revolutions began, the country was all over the news once again, this time for allegedly interfering in the American presidential election. As talks concerning the situation in the Middle East continue and the conflict in Ukraine rages on, not to mention the unfolding of Trump’s presidency and the effect of his drastically different outlook on Russia, 2017 may even rival its century-earlier counterpart in terms of its significance for Russia and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>But 1917 was not the only year in which the world’s largest country underwent a definitive transformation. There is reason to believe that the Russian national character, relationships with other countries and position on the world stage we see today started to take shape long before then. Official Soviet historiography presented the October Revolution as the single event during which the “logically predetermined” destiny of not only what was to become the Soviet Union, but of human society in its entirety, was realised.<a href="#fn:1">1</a> While the West is generally sceptical of such historical determinism and of positive portrayals of the revolution, the Western and Soviet interpretations converge in one key way: both give the revolution prime position as a crucial turning point in the making of Russia. However, another, often overlooked revolution is a contender for this position. This revolution, taking place on a snow-muffled square in St. Petersburg in the otherwise unglamorous year of 1825, was not a barricade-building, flag-hoisting, jubilant triumph of liberty over tyranny. On the contrary, it was a disorganised mess which failed risibly. Its most immediately visible result was inspiring the new Tsar, Nicholas I, to tighten censorship and crack down ever more harshly on dissent.</p>
<p>Known as the Decembrist Revolt, the revolution in question was not an average ‘turning point revolution’ – but Russia was not an average country. Arguably, any country spanning such a large area and comprising a correspondingly wide variety of cultures, nations and geographical influences is bound to struggle with its national identity at some point, and in 1825, this was exactly what the Russian Empire was doing. At this point, the country was ostensibly in a rather strong position. Over a century after Peter the Great expressed and took the first steps towards the aim of reorganising the Empire based on a ‘European’ model (chiefly in the cultural and military<a href="#fn:2">2</a> spheres), his great- great-grandson, Alexander I, made it a recognised European power after cementing Napoleon’s defeat in the Russian Campaign of 1812.</p>
<p>Due to this significant victory, Alexander I’s government played an instrumental role in dividing up post-Napoleonic Europe at the Vienna Congress and gained considerable influence on the continent.<a href="#fn:3">3</a> Even before Napoleon’s defeat, Russia had been pursuing heavily expansionist foreign policy, most notably under the ‘enlightened despot’ Catherine the Great, who sought to extend her influence over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Black Sea region<a href="#fn:4">4</a> while professing her adherence to European Enlightenment ideals.<a href="#fn:5">5</a> But in spite of its deceptively strong, modernising appearance, the country’s problems ran deep. While Western and Central European countries embraced industrial capitalism and improved their armed forces and political statuses with the</p>
<p>consequent growth, serfdom and reluctance to implement much-needed reforms held back their Eastern neighbour.<a href="#fn:6">6</a> From here, Russia had three potential paths. It could have actualised Peter I &amp; Catherine II’s progressive rhetoric and enacted the reforms needed to trim its bureaucracy and become a modern, European nation. It could have retreated into the isolation it experienced for much of the pre-Enlightenment period, remaining feudal, autocratic and reactionary in outlook. Or it could have remained mired in this identity crisis, forever switching between reform and reaction. Of course, no one event can completely shape a country’s future – but December 26th, 1825, represents when Russia’s path started to become clear.</p>
<p>The revolt began after, once Alexander I died, his brothers (and the potential heirs) pledged allegiance to each other. A confused interregnum followed, during which it became apparent that the deceased Tsar had named the future Nicholas I heir presumptive, having bypassed Nicholas’ older brother Konstantin after he renounced the throne and married a Polish woman of non-noble birth. Although Konstantin had been a heavy-handed ruler in Poland and his credentials as a reformer remain unclear, the Decembrists openly advocated peasant emancipation and constitutional monarchy<a href="#fn:7">7</a> and evidently swore allegiance to him because they believed that he was sufficiently liberal and was the rightful heir.</p>
<p>Despite their liberal aims, the Decembrists did not hail from typically progressive social strata.The crowd which assembled at Senate Square on December 26th, 1825, to swear allegiance to Konstantin</p>
<p>and to the Decembrist Constitution were mostly officers of noble backgrounds. The appointed leader of the group, Sergei Trubetskoy, was the son of a Georgian Princess and formerly part of the Semyonovsky regiment which fought against Napoleon, while the author of its official charter, Pavel Pestel, was the son of the notoriously corrupt governor-general of Siberia and was a colonel in the Viatsky regiment.<a href="#fn:8">8</a> More unusual still were the group’s ties to freemasonry; the Union of Prosperity had a masonic structure and was distinctly Christian, but was still inspired by liberals and French revolutionaries, right down to their clothing. This Union spearheaded the revolt, along with regimental leaders whom they convinced to join them in order to increase numbers.</p>
<p>In the end, though, their efforts to increase numbers were fruitless. On the day of the revolt, 3,000 officers gathered at Senate Square in St. Petersburg to protest, though the other troops in St. Petersburg who were supposed to join the revolt made no appearance. Trubetskoy was also absent, as was his second-in-command. Following several hours of deadlock, the general Mikhail Miloradovich was shot and stabbed to death while attempting to reach an agreement with the rebels. After that, Nicholas I concluded that the standoff could not be brought to a peaceful end and ordered cannons to open fire on the rebels. One failed attack on the Winter Palace and one regroupment quashed by artillery fire later, the revolt ended in dismal failure, with 1,721 dead in all. The chronic disorganisation of the rebels led to the revolution effort completely collapsing.<a href="#fn:9">9</a></p>
<p>Not only was the immediate result of the uprising the opposite to what one would expect of a revolution of significance; the uprising is widely credited as the main cause for Nicholas I’s suspicion of liberals<a href="#fn:10">10</a> and thus its main effect was actually to hold back reforms in Russia. Instead of accelerating the progression towards modern liberal democracy, as some other influential European revolutions (against which Nicholas I was keen to act as a bulwark of reaction) did this century, this revolution consigned Russia to a state of ideologically-motivated reaction which has never really gone away. The decades immediately after the revolution were decades of resigned compliance for liberals. To counter the threat of liberalism, the Tsar’s education minister, Sergei Uvarov, was tasked with coming up with a doctrinal or ideological basis for Russian education policy, which soon became the state mantra “Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality.”<a href="#fn:11">11</a> This is of importance in that it showed Nicholas I’s push towards greater ‘Russification’, emphasising the Russian language, religion and ’natural’ style of government, and thus a move away from the Europeanism cultivated by Peter the Great and certain successors of his.</p>
<p>However, there is more nuance to this situation. After Nicholas I reacted decidedly against Europeanism and liberalism by implementing a firmly conservative state ideology, Russia did not remain to this day a country defined by “Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality.” In fact, the next Tsar, Alexander II, was best-known for finally emancipating the serfs in 1861 and, had he not been assassinated, would have signed a set of reforms aimed at giving Russia a constitution.<a href="#fn:12">12</a> Alexander III, who succeeded him, aborted the reforms and led Russia in a more autocratic manner once more; only to have his efforts at re-establishing a stable autocracy sabotaged by Nicholas II, who was forced to yield to his angry subjects after the 1905 revolution and grant them a Parliament and constitution. Soon afterwards, of course, were the substantially more famous revolutions of 1917. A full discussion of the liberal and reactionary trends in the Soviet Union would require a whole other essay, but in short, the vacillation between a suppressive, highly centralised political and economic culture (existent under Stalin and, to a lesser degree, under Brezhnev’s re-centralisation programme) and something resembling attempts at <em>glasnost’</em> (or similar policies or lip service, such as Khrushchev’s Thaw) seems to mirror the vacillation between semi-liberalism and autocracy under the Russian Empire in the decades after the Decembrist Revolt.</p>
<p>Even in modern Russia, this familiar pattern continues. After Yeltsin appeared to envisage a modern, open Russia as the future, Putin has embraced anti-West, stubborn autocratic policy and put a nail in the coffin of the notion that 21st-century Russia could become a Western-style democracy. The outward appearance of modern Russia is often one of strength; as the Western order seems to be disintegrating after the populist onslaught and politicians like Trump and Fillon openly praise Putin’s leadership, one would be forgiven for thinking that Russia is remarkably stable and self-assured in comparison with countries like the United States. Yet the legacy of the Decembrist Revolt suggests otherwise. It seems evident, judging by Russian history ever since the revolt, that Russia chose the last of the three paths: the path of perpetual identity crisis, caused by the cautiousness of Russian liberals and the fear of liberalism which the country seems to have had ever since Nicholas I first cracked down on them in 1826. Every time anyone tries to reach out tentatively towards a more liberal future, the attempt is retracted; and yet, Russia does not have enough conviction in its autocratic spirit to last a considerable amount of time without such an attempt. At base, in spite of all pretensions to the country, the Russian Federation of 2017 is fundamentally unsure of itself.</p>
